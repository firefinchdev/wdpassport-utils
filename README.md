## Introduction

This project is based on the work done by the following people: KenMacD, funkypopcorn and Dan Lukes.

I re-wrote the GUI part of the unlocker to make it more user friendly. The script can be executed as:

Execute run.sh

OR

./run.sh

OR

sudo ./wd-security.py

More updates coming. Please email me your comments.
